To run the simulation successfully, first you need to install Anaconda2
and then install Gurobi to Anaconda.

Python version: 2.7.11 (Anaconda2)

Gurobi version: 7.0.2

`simulation_online.py` is the main file for online algorithms and
`simulation_offline.py` is for offline algorithms.

Notice: The data file (`task_events_out.csv`) for online simulation 
has not been uploaded, since it is too large. So others can only run the
file `simulation_offline.py`, otherwise it will throw an exception. If
you want to run the online simulation, you can contact me through e-mail.
